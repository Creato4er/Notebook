### About

Notebook is a place where you showcase your work and your design. It's a static page where you display your details and the projects you have worked on. If you are a person who works on hundreds of your projects and want to showcase your work, then this page will try to help you in doing so. It will keep track of the languages that you are learning and the projects you are doing. So it's a notebook for your development.
